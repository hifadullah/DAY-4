In JavaScript, window, document, and screen are all important objects but serve different purposes within the browser environment. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

window:

The window object represents the browser window or tab.

It's the global object in client-side JavaScript, representing the entire browser window and containing methods, properties, and events.

window is the top-level object that encompasses everything in the browser environment, including the document object, which represents the current webpage loaded in the window.

It provides methods to manipulate the browser window, control navigation, interact with the user, set timeouts/intervals, handle events, and more.


document:

The document object represents the current HTML document loaded in the browser window or tab.

It's a property of the window object (window.document) and provides access to the DOM (Document Object Model) of the current webpage.

The document object allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the structure, content, and styling of the HTML document.

It provides methods for selecting elements (getElementById, querySelector, etc.), modifying content (innerHTML, textContent, etc.), handling events, and more.


screen:

 The screen object represents the user's screen or monitor.

It provides information about the user's display properties such as width, height, color depth, and pixel density.

Unlike window and document, screen is not a property of window; it's a standalone object accessible via window.screen.

Commonly used properties of the screen object include screen.width, screen.height, screen.availWidth, screen.availHeight, screen.pixelDepth,
